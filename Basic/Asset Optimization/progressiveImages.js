/**

 Progressive Images are used to improve the user experience if we are loading large image files. For this we need the main image and a smaller pixel sized image of the main image, and in the image tag we can use an attribute named src which will take the placeHolder image which is the tiny image. now we need to use an Image object which will take the image path/link in the src property and onload of the image we change the tiny image to the main image and add an blur affect, so its pleasing to the eyes.
